                data-text="In this project, I address the temporality of more-than-human entities. Since humans construct the concept and measurement of time we experience daily, could we instead experience time through the changes or movements of non-human elements? 
                
                I conceived the idea of using tides to indicate time. The basic pattern of tides is primarily determined by the gravitational forces of the moon and sun, giving them a relatively predictable periodicity. Although tides are generally regular, observed tides may exhibit some irregularities due to meteorological factors, terrain, wind, and atmospheric pressure.|
                
                Tides could provide me with a blurry indicator of time.|
                
                Although I found an API that I can call to get the tide data, I realized it doesn't support JavaScrpit. So, I decided to get the tide data mannually and use P5 to make a protptype. |
                
                How it works: Two blue circles indicate the day's high and low tides. When you click the interface, it generates a new clock based on a random location's tide data. Two purple circles show the tide range within a specific time frame, while a red line represents the current (predicted) tide height.|
                
                This project inspired me to reflect on how time is constriced by human and how we may 'obsereve' the time theough the elements around us instade of using clock.">

                data-text="In this project, I aimed to combine elements from Rin, Rex, and myself into a single sketch.| 
                Rin drew a LEGO character wearing a The New School t-shirt, Rex provided an illustration from his favorite brand, Balenciaga, and I drew a penguin with a scarf. To create my own sketch, I drew a penguin wearing a scarf with The New School logo, and I styled its hair to resemble the people in Rex’s illustration. Since I know Rex is a big fan of Balenciaga, I incorporated design elements from this brand into the interaction—when the mouse is pressed, the penguin will wear Balenciaga clothing. I imagined a playful story where the penguin goes to a Balenciaga runway after school.">

                data-text="The works I saw on OpenProcessing sparked my interest in particle systems. In the code for those works, they used concepts like 'class' and concise syntax (such as arrow functions)—many of which I didn’t fully understand when I studied programming during my undergraduate years. I tried asking ChatGPT to explain the parts of the code I didn’t understand, and it took me over two hours to roughly grasp the logic behind it.|
                After understanding the code, I attempted to modify it and designed a unique interaction where a shape is generated at the point where the mouse clicks. While modifying the code, I realized there were many parts I thought I understood but actually didn’t. In order to achieve the effect I wanted, I had to fully comprehend the original code, and during the process, I learned a lot about the logic that I might have overlooked when browsing the code. The current effect has not yet reached my expectations, and I still hope to add gradient effects to the shape. After completing this project, I hope to have the opportunity to try writing a particle system from scratch.">

                data-text="For this project, I collected the parts of 3 books I recently read that I highlighted and used chatgpt to count the word frequency of the words that appeared. I started out originally wanting to create a word cloud map, but then realized that there is no similar library in p5js. So I gave up on that idea.｜
                 Then I thought of the word2vec project: it transforms words into vectors in a space where words with more similar and related meanings are closer together in that space. So I wanted to try to analyze the connections between words in my reading notes. But I found that I couldn't use my reading notes to create a model to get the vectors of words in a short period of time, so I decided to make a simple mockup - I randomly generated the position of each word using gpt and visualized it in P5. I linked words that were close together with a red line.">

                data-text="The inspiration for my game comes from my experience during my undergraduate thesis project. Many of the ideas I proposed (almost all of them) were questioned by my professors, which made me feel like they were opposing me just for the sake of opposing me. This kind of opposition didn't actually help my project. I felt like I could never convince them to accept my ideas, and everything I said was doubted, which made me feel hopeless. However, over time, I stopped caring so much about others' opinions of my project. I decided to stick with doing what I wanted to do — and the voices of doubt no longer seemed as important. This experience inspired me to design this ’dialogue game. During the development of this game, I was, in a way, ‘healing’ the hopeless, self-doubting version of myself. That’s why I named it How to Break a ( )'s Heart and Make it Whole Again.|
                All of the responses from the system in the game are based on the feedback that my classmates and I received during my final year of undergraduate studies. As the player persists in the conversation, three states will sequentially appear: both the player’s and the system’s messages are in text; the player’s message is garbled, while the system’s message is in text; and the player’s message is in text, while the system’s message is garbled. I want to present the dynamic of the conversation through this progression. This kind of scenario didn’t only happen during my thesis project, but could occur in any conversation in life. We may never be able to convince each other, and the only thing we can do is persist in our own ideas. Therefore, there is no concept of winning or losing in this game, but we can choose to end this ’dialogue’ at any time.">
