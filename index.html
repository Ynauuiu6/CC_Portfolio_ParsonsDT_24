                data-text="In this project, I address the temporality of more-than-human entities. Since humans construct the concept and measurement of time we experience daily, could we instead experience time through the changes or movements of non-human elements?

                I conceived the idea of using tides to indicate time. The basic pattern of tides is primarily determined by the gravitational forces of the moon and sun, giving them a relatively predictable periodicity. Although tides are generally regular, observed tides may exhibit some irregularities due to meteorological factors, terrain, wind, and atmospheric pressure.
                
                Tides could provide me with a blurry indicator of time.
                
                Although I found an API that I can call to get the tide data, I realized it doesn't support JavaScrpit. So, I decided to get the tide data mannually and use P5 to make a protptype. 
                
                How it works: Two blue circles indicate the day's high and low tides. When you click the interface, it generates a new clock based on a random location's tide data. Two purple circles show the tide range within a specific time frame, while a red line represents the current (predicted) tide height.
                
                This project inspired me to reflect on how time is constriced by human and how we may "obsereve" the time theough the elements around us instade of using clock.">

                data-text="In this project, I aimed to combine elements from Rin, Rex, and myself into a single sketch. Rin drew a LEGO character wearing a The New School t-shirt, Rex provided an illustration from his favorite brand, Balenciaga, and I drew a penguin with a scarf. To create my own sketch, I drew a penguin wearing a scarf with The New School logo, and I styled its hair to resemble the people in Rex’s illustration. Since I know Rex is a big fan of Balenciaga, I incorporated design elements from this brand into the interaction—when the mouse is pressed, the penguin will wear Balenciaga clothing. I imagined a playful story where the penguin goes to a Balenciaga runway after school.">
